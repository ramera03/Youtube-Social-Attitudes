# Research Project Assessment

**This assessment is for the final research project only.** Use the `assessment.md` file for all mini-projects.


## Instructions

Before submitting your research project draft for grading, confirm:

1. The manuscript .qmd for your project is in the root directory and knits to .pdf without error.
2. The knitted .pdf of your draft is in the root directory, with the same filename as the .qmd.
3. This `research-assessment.md` file is in the root directory of your project repo.
4. Dr. Dowling and your section TA are collaborators on your GitHub repo with permissions to pull/push.

To complete this assessment:

1. Complete the basic information section and AI statement. 
2. Confirm all links are correct and accessible
3. Check off all objectives you are attempting to demonstrate
    1. To earn 30 points you must demonstrate each objective. However, you do not need to attempt all objectives with each draft if your goal is to build the project over time.
    2. If the objective is demonstrated somewhere other than the .qmd, add a note in the grader comments section for where to find it (e.g., "see `data-cleaning.R` lines 20-30").
4. Optionally, complete the reflection section, which may earn engagement points.

## AI Statement

Describe whether and how you used AI/LLMs when completing this project: 
I used ChatGPT to help me generate complex functions. I would specify exactly what I wanted the function to do, and then adapt/comment the ChatGPT output to better fit my needs. Such functions include: birthday (calculating participant age based on particular data forms), return_alpha (returns Cronbach's Alpha for subsets of columns), report_anova (function which reports formatted ANOVA results). Functions generated with ChatGPT help has been commented as such. I also used ChatGPT to help create a reliability data frame, and for specific coding questions (e.g. how do I add sums to a contingency table?). Lastly, I used ChatGPT for troubleshooting and render errors (I was having trouble parsing errors related to Lua files. Chat was ultimately unhelpful - I found out that the Lua parts of apaquarto might just be incompatible with library(patchwork)). 

Optionally (for engagement points) reflect on your use of AI:
AI has been a huge time saver throughout this process, particularly in terms of small bugs and quick questions. Where otherwise one might read through many Stackexchange posts in hope that someone might have the same error as you, ChatGPT makes it quite easy to obtain (though not always correct) resources and answers related to your specific issue. Also, as someone who is relatively new to R, I can often picture exactly what I want my functions to do, but as I am less familiar with more complex syntax, I have trouble creating functions that do exactly what I want. Tweaking generated functions has been especially helpful in this regard, and I feel like I have been able to build on my R syntactical knowledge as a result. 


## Overall requirements

Overall requirements for the research project are as follows:

1. The project must be a research project. It must provide background on a research topic, ask at least one research question, use data to attempt to answer that question, report the results of the data analysis, and interpret the results in the context of the research question.
2. The project must be contained in a github repository that follows git best practices and includes all necessary files to run the project from start to finish, including:
    1. The .qmd file for the manuscript
    2. All data files used in the project
    3. All scripts used in the project
    4. A README.md file & .gitignore file
3. The project must be reproducible -- a reader should be able to clone the repo and run the .qmd from start to finish without error. The .qmd file should include:
    1. A YAML header with all fields necessary for an APA manuscript
    2. Setup source chunks that load libraries, read in data, set chunk options, set seed, etc.
    3. Minimally, an IMRD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), though it may be more complex
    4. Integration of markdown and code chunks throughout, following best practices for using code chunks
    5. Figures and tables rendered in code chunks
    6. Inline R code & references to render data-dependent text
    7. At least 1 descriptive analysis and 1 hypothesis test, either in code chunks or sourced scripts
    8. Frequent and informative code comments throughout
4. The .qmd file should knit/render to an APA7 formatted manuscript with one click and no errors. The knitted manuscript should include:
    1. A title page with title, author, and institutional affiliation
    2. An abstract (this may be minimal, but should exist)
    3. Narrative text comprising a complete research report
    4. APA7 references, both in-text citations and a References page
    5. Publication-ready figures (2+) and tables (1+)
    6. Results of all analyses presented in-text (and where appropriate, in tables), with no raw R output; where possible, all text should be data-dependent and rendered with inline R code
    7. Quarto generated references to all figures and tables
    8. Statistical analyses and figures interpreted in narrative text
5. The .qmd should render a .pdf identical to the .pdf you submit for grading


## Assessment

The final project must demonstrate each of 30 the course learning objectives, each worth 1 point. 

Below each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the "parse and define functions and arguments" objective, even if it is only used in one context.

Refer to the website for general tips on meeting these objectives and an FAQ.

        -   Grader comments: You're executing this correctly, but for your final draft you should look around at how psych articles (apa formatted specifically) typically present results in text. Like the silly formatting and stylistic details -- where to put parentheses, when to use a color, what to capitalize, etc. It's more subjective, but you still want to go with standard practice.

### BibTeX

20. Render APA7 in-text citations with BibTeX syntax for multiple citation forms

            1.  add a \clearpage line above # References
            2.  proof your in text references. in particular I'm seeing that your bib file thinks D. Hughes is a different person from D.L. Hughes and giving too much in-text information as a result

### Notebooks and code chunks

22. Create and effectively use code chunks following best practices

    1.  Uses informative names/labels
    2.  Includes frequent, informative comments
    3.  Follows the "1-chunk-1-thing" rule
    4.  Chunks are distributed throughout the manuscript, sensibly placed near the text they support

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: looks great at this point, just be sure to keep it up as you expand your work and add in many more chunks!

    3. Captions are informative, complete, and render correctly
    4. All tables and figures are referenced in the narrative text (e.g., Figure 1)
    5. References render without error and link to the correct table/figure in pdf/html output
    - NOTE: Ideally your table(s) should be produced in APA7 style, but this is not a strict requirement. At a minimum, they should render as formatted tables (not raw output), have readable and correctly formatted text (e.g., column headers should be capitalized and in plain english, not literal variable names), and the table must be dynamically referenced in the text.

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
        Due to The Apaquarto Table Bug, I have two table 1s.

    2. Uses at least 2 unique header levels
    3. Includes at least 1 list
    4. Includes at least 1 footnote
    - NOTE: This is going to be one of the most flexible objectives to demonstrate.  You need to demonstrate a range of markdown skills and use them to make a readable, informative manuscript. Hitting the four points above should do that, but you can use your judgment about what kind of markdown features will best serve your project. No matter what, you should use markdown to follow APA7 guidelines.

        -   [x] Objective attempt

        -   [ ] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
        
30. Use `knitr` and quarto to produce an APA7 formatted 1-click PDF manuscript

    1. Produces a PDF output that is formatted in APA7 style
    2. PDF includes all necessary elements (e.g., title page, abstract, body, references)

        -   Grader comments:        
   

## Reflection (Optional)

Optionally (for engagement points) write a brief reflection about your work on this project. You can use this space to answer the following questions, but feel free to ignore these questions and write about whatever you think is most important.

- What was the most challenging aspect of this project?
- What was the most rewarding aspect of this project?
- What would you do differently if you were to start over?
- What did you learn from this project that you will carry forward to future projects?
- What are you most proud of in this project?

In my last reflection, I expressed feeling like this project was particularly challenging in quite a few ways. Though this project has been challenging, it has been quite rewarding. For instance, this project has given me an opportunity to seriously engage with and analyze my pilot sample data, allowing me to integrate necessary questionnaire changes before I run my full sample. As such, I will be able to streamline data cleaning and analysis in a way that I was unable to in my pilot (just to clarify, I am not changing questions based on results, more so changing questions to make my data workflow easier in the future). In a sense, this is an opportunity to start over, and implement things I would do differently. 
I have learned quite a bit from this project otherwise, particularly in terms of R proficiency and how to create maximally organized and reproducible work (e.g. using relative paths, adding extensive comments, one-chunk-one-thing). I plan to take these R skills and the D2MR workflow with me into future projects. Further, as I continue to work on my thesis, I will build upon the work I have done here. I am happy to be walking away not only with newfound R and GitHub proficiency, but with the basis for my upcoming thesis draft. I look forward to continue building this project a finalized version! 

Alternatively/additionally in mind some of the suggested ways to earn engagement points, and expand on this (or other aspects of your project) in your reflection:

- Creating many figures and tables, or particularly complex or creative ones
- Impressively thoughtful and thorough narrative writing in your literature review or discussion section
- Employing sophisticated statistical techniques in your analysis
- Making excellent use of markdown features to create a polished final product
- Having a maximally reproducible and dynamic manuscript
- Fully committing to best practices for version control and GitHub integration/organization

I am a GitHub convert. After many years of disorganized Google drives, I have really appreciated having all materials related to my thesis in one unified place, and I have fully committed to organizing and using this GitHub to the best of my abilities. 
I also attempted to make my manuscript as dynamic as possible, placing data dependent text wherever I could. As this project was completed only with pilot data, I hope to be able to use much of what I have with my full sample. 


## Grading

All final projects are graded by Dr. Dowling. You will see your grade on Canvas separated into two categories: objective points and engagement points.

-   **Objective points:** 11/30
-   **Engagement points:** 7/10
-   **Total points:** 18/40

**Comments:** Reilly, this is looking great! It's super valid that there's an element of shoehorning things in to meet all the objectives that can be frustrating, but just keep being creative about it. It's just an excuse to practice what you've learned (but again...totally valid to be annoyed by it). Looking forward to your final draft! Also, it would be very very cool if you could turn this into a website, but keep in mind that this is already a challenging undertaking. You're going to keep working on this beyond this class, so it would be totally reasonable to set that as a goal to pursue *after* D2MR.
